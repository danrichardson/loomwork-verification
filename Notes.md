## Plans

So where does Loomwork go from here?

I would like Loomwork to be a thing that people can deploy to quickly publish information on the internet, specifically through 'free' Cloudflare pages publishing. It is not a complicated thing. It's a way to communicate that's quick and easy.

There's pages

A 'blog' - but that's just content organized by date or whatever. Ability to add photos and video - depends on the storage capacity that Cloudflare gives you.

Why? $0 monthly costs. Can set up a neighborhood thing, a small business thing. Probably can handle a lot of people's needs. It's not a social network. It's a personal repository of thoughts, writings, information, whatever you want.

## Shower Thoughts

Need an app - should be easy? - it's basically a markdown editor, or something that can export markdown, cloning a Git repo, and pushing the content to the web.

OK, so it's not that easy - the git part could be a challenge. You need to have a local copy of the repo, but I believe you're just pushing the diffs. Hmhmhmhmhm

Do they know that's all it is? Is there a server-side thing that does the pull/push? No, because that makes it more complicated for ME, which is the thing we don't want to do.

import Callout from '../../components/Callout.astro';

## Prerequisites

You'll need three things before you start:

- A **GitHub account** (free)
- A **Cloudflare account** (free)
- **Node.js 18+** installed on your machine

That's it. No paid services required.

## Step 1: Fork the Repo

Go to the [Loomwork GitHub repo](https://github.com/danrichardson/loomwork) and click **Fork**. This creates your own copy of the project under your GitHub account.

Clone it to your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USER/loomwork.git my-site
cd my-site
npm install
```

Run the dev server to make sure everything works:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see the site at `http://localhost:4321`.

## Step 2: Rebrand

Open `src/site.config.ts` and change the name, tagline, description, nav items, and footer to match your project. This is the single file that controls the entire site's identity.

Then open `src/styles/global.css` and change the CSS variables under `:root` — colors, fonts, spacing. These cascade through every page automatically.

## Step 3: Replace the Content

Delete the example pages in `src/content/pages/` and create your own `.mdx` files. Each file needs YAML frontmatter at the top:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Page Title"
description: "A short description for SEO."
section: "docs"
nav_order: 10
template: "default"
---
```

The file path becomes the URL. A file at `src/content/pages/docs/getting-started.mdx` renders at `/docs/getting-started`.

## Step 4: Connect to Cloudflare

1. Push your changes to GitHub
2. Go to **Cloudflare Dashboard → Workers & Pages → Create → Pages → Connect to Git**
3. Select your forked repo
4. Set the build settings:
   - **Build command:** `npm run build`
   - **Build output directory:** `dist`
5. Click **Deploy**

<Callout type="tip" title="First deploy takes ~60 seconds">
  Subsequent deploys after a git push are faster — usually under 30 seconds.
</Callout>

## Step 5: Add a Custom Domain

In your Cloudflare Pages project, go to **Settings → Domains & Routes** and add your custom domain. If your domain's DNS is already on Cloudflare, it connects automatically. Otherwise, add a CNAME record pointing to your worker's `.workers.dev` URL.

## The Authoring Workflow

Once deployed, your day-to-day workflow is:

1. Write or edit `.mdx` files in any text editor (Typora works great on Windows)
2. Drop images alongside your content files
3. Commit and push:

```bash
git add . && git commit -m "new post" && git push
```

Cloudflare detects the push, builds, and deploys. Your changes are live in under a minute.

## Page Templates

Loomwork includes four layout templates you can set in frontmatter:

- **`default`** — Standard content page, centered at a comfortable reading width
- **`landing`** — Wider layout with no sidebar, good for home pages
- **`guide`** — Includes a sticky table of contents sidebar (like this page)
- **`tool`** — Minimal chrome, wide container, designed for interactive components

## Using Components in MDX

You can import Astro or React components directly in your content:

```mdx
import Callout from '../../components/Callout.astro';

<Callout type="warning" title="Heads up">
  This is a warning callout rendered inline in your markdown.
</Callout>
```

Built-in components include `Callout` (info, warning, tip, danger) and `YouTube` (responsive video embeds). Add your own to `src/components/`.

## Adding Interactive Features

For calculators, forms, or other interactive elements, create React components in `src/components/` and use Astro's island architecture:

```astro
import MyWidget from '../components/MyWidget';

<MyWidget client:load />
```

The `client:load` directive hydrates the component on the client side. The rest of the page stays static HTML.

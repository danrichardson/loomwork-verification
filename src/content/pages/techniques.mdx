The difference between good seafood and great seafood is almost always technique. Fish and shellfish cook fast — which means small errors compound quickly, but so do small improvements. These are the skills worth building.

## Grilling Fish

The two rules of grilling fish: **get the grill hot, and leave the fish alone**.

### The Setup

- Clean grates thoroughly — old residue sticks to fish. Use a wire brush while the grill is cold, then a folded paper towel with tongs to oil the grates when hot.
- Preheat to at least 450°F. For whole fish or thick fillets, higher is better.
- **Skin-on fillets** go skin-side down first. The skin protects the flesh and crisps up into something worth eating.

### The Method

1. Pat fish completely dry. Any moisture steams instead of sears.
2. Oil the fish (not just the grates), season generously.
3. Lay on grill at a 45-degree angle to the grates.
4. Do not move it. A properly cooked piece of fish releases naturally when it's ready — usually 4–6 minutes for a 1-inch fillet.
5. Flip once, cook 2–4 minutes more.

<Callout type="tip" title="The release test">
  Gently slide a spatula under the fish at around the 4-minute mark. If it resists, it's not done releasing from the grill. Wait another minute and try again. Forced flips tear the flesh.
</Callout>

### What to Grill

- **Salmon:** Forgiving, fatty, easy. Great with char.
- **Swordfish steaks:** Meaty, holds together well — treat it like a steak.
- **Whole branzino:** Slit the sides, stuff with herbs, grill 6–8 minutes per side.
- **Shrimp:** Skewer them, 2 minutes per side max.

<Callout type="warning" title="Avoid delicate flaky fish on direct grill">
  Tilapia, flounder, and thin sole fillets fall apart over direct heat. Use a fish basket, foil, or a grill pan for these.

## Shucking Oysters

Shucking intimidates people, but with the right tool and a little technique, it becomes satisfying and fast.

### What You Need

- A proper oyster knife (short, blunt-tipped blade — not a paring knife)
- A folded kitchen towel or cut-resistant glove
- A steady surface

### The Method

1. **Position the oyster** cupped-side down in the towel, with the hinge (the pointy end) facing you.
2. **Insert the knife** at the hinge, working it into the small gap. Apply firm, controlled pressure — more wiggle than force.
3. **Twist** the knife to pop the hinge. You'll feel a distinct pop.
4. **Slide the blade** along the underside of the top shell to cut the adductor muscle. Remove the top shell.
5. **Run the knife** under the oyster in the bottom shell to cut the lower muscle. Keep the oyster in its liquor.

<Callout type="danger" title="Protect your hand">
  The most common shucking injury is a slip that sends the knife into the palm. Keep your holding hand in a towel at all times and never point the knife toward your body.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="Chill the oysters first">
  Cold oysters are easier to shuck — the muscle is firmer and the shell liquor is better retained. Keep them on ice right up until you open them.

## Making Fish Stock

A good fish stock is the backbone of chowders, bisques, and coastal pan sauces. It takes 30 minutes, not hours.

### Ingredients

- 2 lbs fish bones and heads (halibut, cod, snapper — avoid oily fish like salmon)
- 1 onion, roughly chopped
- 2 stalks celery, chopped
- 1 fennel bulb, chopped (optional but excellent)
- 1 cup dry white wine
- 6 cups cold water
- 1 bay leaf, fresh thyme, parsley stems, black peppercorns

### Steps

1. **Rinse bones** well in cold water. Remove any visible blood or dark bits.
2. **Sweat vegetables** in butter in a stockpot over medium heat for 5 minutes.
3. **Add bones and wine.** Bring to a simmer.
4. **Add cold water** and aromatics. Bring to a gentle simmer — never a rolling boil.
5. **Skim** any foam that rises in the first few minutes.
6. **Simmer 20–25 minutes.** No longer — overcooked fish stock turns bitter and gelatinous in the wrong way.
7. **Strain** through a fine-mesh strainer. Cool quickly and refrigerate up to 3 days or freeze up to 3 months.

<Callout type="info" title="Clam broth shortcut">
  When you don't have fish bones, the liquid from steaming clams makes an excellent quick stock. Save it every time you cook clams.

## Pan-Searing Seafood

A proper sear is the difference between fish that tastes bland and fish with a crisp, golden crust and concentrated flavor.

### The Setup

- **Cast iron** or **stainless steel** — not nonstick. Nonstick can't reach the temperatures needed for a true crust.
- The pan must be genuinely hot before the fish goes in. Hold your hand 3 inches over the surface — you should feel serious heat.
- Use a neutral oil with a high smoke point: grapeseed, avocado, or refined sunflower.

### For Fillets

1. Pat completely dry with paper towels (the single most important step).
2. Season generously with salt on all sides. Let rest 10–15 minutes.
3. Add oil to screaming-hot pan, lay fillet presentation-side down.
4. Press gently to ensure contact. Don't move it.
5. When edges are opaque halfway up the fillet (3–4 minutes), flip.
6. Add butter, baste for 1 minute. Rest briefly before serving.

<Callout type="tip" title="Season with salt in advance">
  Salt draws moisture from the surface, which then dissolves back into the flesh as a natural brine. Fish salted 15 minutes ahead has better flavor and a drier surface — which means a better sear.
</Callout>

### For Scallops

The same rules apply, but even more aggressive: bone-dry, very hot pan, high-smoke-point oil. Scallops need 90 seconds per side maximum. Look for a deep mahogany crust on the flat face.

<Callout type="warning" title="Wet-pack vs. dry-pack scallops">
  "Wet-pack" scallops are treated with sodium tripolyphosphate, which makes them absorb water. They steam instead of sear and never develop a crust. Always buy "dry-pack" or "diver" scallops, even if they cost more.
</Callout>

## Curing Fish

A simple cure — salt, sugar, and aromatics — transforms raw fish into something silky, deeply flavored, and shelf-stable for several days. Gravlax is the classic example.

### Basic Gravlax

- 1 lb salmon fillet, skin-on, pin bones removed
- 3 tbsp kosher salt
- 2 tbsp granulated sugar
- 1 tbsp freshly cracked black pepper
- 1 bunch fresh dill

**Method:**

1. Mix salt, sugar, and pepper in a small bowl.
2. Lay a large sheet of plastic wrap on a baking sheet.
3. Place salmon skin-side down on wrap. Pack cure mixture evenly over flesh. Cover with dill.
4. Wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate with a weight on top (a second baking sheet with a can works).
5. After 24 hours, flip and redistribute any liquid. Cure 24–48 hours total depending on thickness.
6. Unwrap, rinse briefly, and pat dry. Slice thin on a bias.

<Callout type="info" title="Salt ratio is flexible">
  The 3:2 salt-to-sugar ratio gives a savory cure. More sugar makes a sweeter, Scandinavian-style gravlax. You can also add citrus zest, beet juice, or aquavit to the cure mix.
</Callout>

<Callout type="danger" title="Use sushi-grade or previously frozen salmon">
  To reduce parasite risk, cure only salmon labeled sushi-grade or salmon that has been commercially frozen at -4°F or colder for at least 7 days. Home freezers are generally adequate.

A well-stocked coastal pantry means you can turn whatever fish or shellfish you find at the market into something great without a special grocery run. These are the ingredients we reach for constantly.

## Fats and Oils

### Extra-Virgin Olive Oil

The workhorse of coastal cooking. Use it for dressings, finishing, and any application where the flavor matters. Don't use your good olive oil for high-heat searing — it will smoke and turn bitter.

Keep two: a good bottle for finishing and dressings, and a cheaper one for general cooking.

<Callout type="tip" title="Storage matters">
  Olive oil degrades with heat and light. Store in a cool, dark cabinet — not next to the stove. Buy smaller bottles more often rather than a large one that sits around.
</Callout>

### Neutral Oil (Grapeseed or Avocado)

Essential for high-heat searing. Grapeseed oil has a smoke point around 420°F; avocado oil around 520°F. Keep one on hand specifically for cast iron work.

### Unsalted Butter

Always unsalted so you control the seasoning. Used for basting, making pan sauces, and finishing pasta dishes like scampi. Buy European-style butter (higher fat, lower water content) when you can — it browns more evenly.

## Acids

### Lemons (and Limes)

The most important finishing tool in coastal cooking. A squeeze of fresh lemon at the end of cooking brightens every seafood dish. Always taste before you think you're done — the answer is usually more acid.

Zest is just as useful as juice. Add zest to compound butters, breadcrumb toppings, and dressings.

<Callout type="info" title="Microplane zesting">
  A Microplane grater produces fine, dry zest that incorporates evenly into everything. Worth having in any seafood kitchen.

### White Wine Vinegar

For quick pickles (shallots in white wine vinegar are a classic mignonette for oysters), acidic dressings, and pan sauce deglazing when you want sharper acidity than wine.

### Fish Sauce

Technically not an "acid," but it behaves like one — it adds depth and umami to sauces and braises without tasting fishy. A tablespoon in your clam chowder or shrimp bisque changes the entire dish. Red Boat brand (Vietnamese) is excellent.

---

## Aromatics

### Shallots

Milder and sweeter than onions. Classic in mignonette, pan sauces, and compound butters. Worth having on hand at all times.

### Garlic

No explanation needed. For coastal cooking, use it raw in aioli and dressings, gently sweated for sauces, and roasted whole for mellower dishes.

### Fennel (Fresh and Dried)

Fennel has a natural affinity for fish and seafood. The fresh bulb pairs beautifully in stocks and braises. Ground fennel seed in rubs for grilled fish is underrated.

---

## Dried Spices

### Old Bay Seasoning

The quintessential American seafood spice blend. Use it in crab cakes, shrimp boils, chowders, and as a finishing sprinkle. If you're cooking mid-Atlantic or Gulf-style seafood, Old Bay belongs in your pantry.

### Smoked Paprika

Adds depth and a subtle smoke without a grill. Excellent in Spanish-style seafood stews, romesco sauce, and dusted on grilled shrimp.

### Cayenne and Red Pepper Flakes

Heat is a running thread in coastal cuisines worldwide — Cajun, Spanish, Thai, Portuguese. Keep both forms: cayenne for smooth heat in sauces, flakes for texture in pan dishes.

### Black Pepper (Whole, Fresh-Ground)

Buy whole peppercorns and grind them yourself. Pre-ground pepper loses most of its volatile aromatics within a few weeks. For a gravlax cure or a classic shrimp scampi, freshly cracked black pepper is noticeably better.

<Callout type="tip" title="Toast and grind in small batches">
  For spice rubs, toast whole spices in a dry skillet for 30–60 seconds until fragrant, then grind in a small spice grinder or mortar. The difference in flavor is significant.

## Condiments and Preserved Items

### Capers

Briny, acidic, and pungent — capers punch above their weight in seafood dishes. Classically used in piccata, with smoked salmon, in tartar sauce, and tossed with brown butter over halibut. Rinse before using if packed in salt; drain if packed in brine.

### Preserved Lemons

A North African staple that belongs in every seafood pantry. The cured rind adds an intensely saline, floral, concentrated lemon flavor that fresh lemon can't replicate. Use them in fish tagines, grain salads with smoked fish, and marinades.

You can make your own (pack lemon quarters in salt, cure 3–4 weeks) or buy them. Moroccan brands are typically excellent.

### Anchovy Fillets (Oil-Packed)

Anchovies melt into sauces and add a deep savory backbone without any fishy flavor when used correctly. Dissolve 2–3 fillets in olive oil with garlic as a base for pasta sauces, dressings, or braised greens served alongside fish.

<Callout type="warning" title="Quality varies enormously">
  Cheap anchovies are mushy and overly salty. Look for Cantabrian anchovies from Spain or good Italian brands (Ortiz is widely available). The flavor difference is dramatic.
</Callout>

### Worcestershire Sauce

A fermented condiment with tamarind, vinegar, and anchovies at its core. Adds complexity to chowders, crab cakes, and cocktail sauce. A few dashes in a Bloody Mary with oysters is a revelation.

### Dijon Mustard

A binder and emulsifier as much as a condiment. Essential in remoulade, compound butters, and the breading mix for crab cakes. Keeps dressings stable and adds mild heat.

## Canned and Shelf-Stable Seafood

<Callout type="info" title="Canned seafood is real cooking">
  The best tinned fish — Ortiz tuna, Scout sardines, Fishwife smoked salmon — is a legitimate ingredient, not a compromise. Keep a selection and you always have a coastal meal available.
</Callout>

### Good Canned Tuna (Oil-Packed)

Oil-packed tuna, especially Spanish Ortiz brand, has a completely different texture and flavor from water-packed American tuna. Use it for pan con tomate, grain bowls, Niçoise-style salads, and pasta.

### Sardines

High in omega-3s, intensely flavored, and excellent on toast with good butter and cornichons. Also excellent in pasta — fry with garlic, add cherry tomatoes and pasta cooking water, finish with breadcrumbs and parsley.

### Clam Juice (Bottled)

A convenient substitute for homemade clam stock in chowders and pasta sauces. Clam juice is saltier than homemade stock — reduce all other salt in the recipe until you taste.

---

## Salt

### Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt

The standard in most professional kitchens. It's less dense than Morton kosher salt (use 1.5x if substituting Morton) and much less dense than table salt. Use it for seasoning fish and in curing mixes. The flake size makes it easy to control with your fingers.

### Flaky Sea Salt (Maldon or Similar)

Used only for finishing — a pinch of Maldon on a piece of seared fish or an oyster on the half shell adds crunch, visual appeal, and a clean salt flavor that kosher salt can't replicate at the table.

<Callout type="tip" title="Salt your fish early">
  For pan-seared fish, salt the fillets 15–30 minutes before cooking and let them rest uncovered on a rack. The surface moisture draws out, dissolves the salt, and re-absorbs — giving you a natural brine and a drier surface that sears instead of steams.

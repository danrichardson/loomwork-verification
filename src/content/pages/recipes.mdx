## New England Clam Chowder

A thick, creamy chowder built on a proper clam stock. This is not the canned-soup version.

**Serves:** 4–6 | **Time:** 1 hour

### Ingredients

- 3 lbs littleneck or cherrystone clams, scrubbed
- 4 strips thick-cut bacon, diced
- 1 large yellow onion, diced
- 3 stalks celery, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp all-purpose flour
- 2 cups clam broth (from steaming, see below)
- 2 cups whole milk
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 lb Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and diced into ½-inch cubes
- 2 bay leaves
- Fresh thyme, salt, white pepper, and oyster crackers to serve

### Steps

1. **Steam the clams.** Add clams to a large pot with ½ cup water over high heat. Cover and steam 5–8 minutes until clams open. Discard any that don't open. Remove clam meat and roughly chop. Strain broth through cheesecloth and reserve.
2. **Render the bacon** in a heavy pot over medium heat until crispy. Remove bacon, leave fat in pot.
3. **Sweat aromatics.** Add onion and celery to bacon fat; cook 6–8 minutes until soft. Add garlic, cook 1 minute more.
4. **Make a roux.** Sprinkle flour over vegetables, stir and cook 2 minutes.
5. **Add liquids.** Whisk in clam broth, then add milk and cream. Add potatoes and bay leaves.
6. **Simmer** 15–20 minutes until potatoes are tender.
7. **Finish.** Add clam meat and bacon. Season with salt, white pepper, and fresh thyme. Remove bay leaves. Serve immediately with oyster crackers.

<Callout type="tip" title="Don't boil after adding clams">
  Boiling toughens clam meat. Add the chopped clams at the end and just heat through — about 2 minutes is plenty.

## Grilled Salmon with Herb Butter

Simple and fast. The key is a very hot grill and not moving the fish until it releases naturally.

**Serves:** 4 | **Time:** 20 minutes

### Ingredients

- 4 salmon fillets, skin-on, about 6 oz each
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 4 tbsp unsalted butter, softened
- 2 tbsp fresh dill, chopped
- 1 tbsp fresh chives, minced
- 1 tsp lemon zest
- Lemon wedges for serving

### Steps

1. **Make herb butter.** Combine butter, dill, chives, and lemon zest. Mix well. Roll into a log in plastic wrap and refrigerate (or use immediately).
2. **Prep grill.** Heat grill to high (450°F+). Clean grates well and oil them.
3. **Season salmon.** Brush fillets with olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper on both sides.
4. **Grill skin-side down** 4–5 minutes without moving. The fish will release when it's ready — don't force it.
5. **Flip** and cook another 2–3 minutes for medium (internal temp 130°F) or 3–4 for well-done.
6. **Serve** with a slice of herb butter melting over each fillet.

<Callout type="warning" title="Don't skip drying the fish">
  Pat fillets completely dry before oiling. Any surface moisture creates steam and prevents the grill marks and crust you want.

## Oysters Rockefeller

A classic New Orleans preparation with wilted greens, anise, and breadcrumbs. Rich and elegant.

**Serves:** 4 (as an appetizer) | **Time:** 35 minutes

### Ingredients

- 24 oysters on the half shell, on a bed of rock salt
- 4 tbsp unsalted butter
- 3 shallots, finely minced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 cups fresh spinach, packed
- 2 tbsp Pernod or other anise liqueur
- ¼ cup heavy cream
- ½ cup Parmesan, finely grated
- ½ cup breadcrumbs
- Salt, white pepper, Tabasco

### Steps

1. **Preheat broiler** to high.
2. **Make the topping.** Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add shallots and garlic; cook 3 minutes. Add spinach, stir until wilted. Add Pernod and let it reduce 30 seconds. Add cream and cook until slightly thickened. Season with salt, pepper, and a dash of Tabasco.
3. **Blitz.** Transfer mixture to a food processor and pulse a few times until coarsely chopped (not pureed).
4. **Top oysters.** Place a small spoonful of spinach mixture on each oyster. Mix Parmesan and breadcrumbs; top each oyster with a pinch.
5. **Broil** 3–4 minutes until topping is golden and bubbling. Watch carefully — they go from perfect to burnt quickly.

<Callout type="danger" title="Hot rock salt">
  The rock salt bed gets extremely hot under the broiler. Use oven mitts and warn guests before serving.

## Pan-Seared Halibut with Brown Butter

Halibut is meaty and mild — it's all about the crust. A proper sear in a screaming-hot pan and a finish of brown butter is all this fish needs.

**Serves:** 2 | **Time:** 20 minutes

### Ingredients

- 2 halibut fillets, about 6 oz each, 1 inch thick
- 2 tbsp neutral oil (grapeseed or avocado)
- 4 tbsp unsalted butter
- 2 cloves garlic, smashed
- 4 sprigs fresh thyme
- Salt and pepper
- Lemon, capers, and fresh parsley to serve

### Steps

1. **Dry and season** fillets thoroughly. Salt both sides and let rest on a rack for 15 minutes at room temperature.
2. **Heat pan.** Cast iron or stainless steel over high heat until smoking.
3. **Add oil** and immediately add fillets, presentation-side down.
4. **Press gently** for the first 30 seconds to ensure full contact. Cook 3–4 minutes undisturbed until golden-brown crust forms and fish releases naturally.
5. **Flip.** Add butter, garlic, and thyme to the pan. As butter foams, tilt pan and baste fillets continuously for 1–2 minutes.
6. **Brown butter.** Continue cooking butter until it smells nutty and turns golden amber.
7. **Serve** immediately, spooning brown butter over fish. Finish with lemon juice, capers, and parsley.

<Callout type="tip" title="One-inch thickness is key">
  Thinner halibut overcooks before you build a crust. Ask your fishmonger for thick-cut portions or cut from the center of a larger fillet.

## Shrimp Scampi

The Italian-American classic done right: garlicky, winey, buttery, bright with lemon. Ready in 15 minutes.

**Serves:** 4 | **Time:** 15 minutes

### Ingredients

- 1.5 lbs large shrimp (16/20 count), peeled and deveined, tails on
- 6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- ½ cup dry white wine (Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc)
- 4 tbsp unsalted butter
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- ½ tsp red pepper flakes
- Juice of 1 lemon
- ¼ cup flat-leaf parsley, chopped
- Salt and pepper
- 12 oz linguine, cooked al dente (reserve 1 cup pasta water)

### Steps

1. **Season shrimp** with salt and pepper.
2. **Sauté garlic.** Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and red pepper flakes; cook 1–2 minutes until fragrant (not brown).
3. **Add shrimp.** Raise heat to medium-high. Add shrimp in a single layer; cook 1–2 minutes per side until just pink and curled. Remove shrimp to a plate.
4. **Deglaze** with white wine. Scrape up any fond. Reduce by half, about 2 minutes.
5. **Finish sauce.** Add butter and lemon juice; swirl to emulsify. Add pasta and a splash of pasta water to loosen.
6. **Return shrimp** to pan and toss everything together. Top with parsley and serve immediately.

<Callout type="info" title="Don't overcook the shrimp">
  Shrimp cook in minutes. They're done when they form a loose "C" shape. An "O" shape means overcooked and rubbery. Pull them from heat while they still look just slightly underdone.

## Maryland-Style Crab Cakes

All crab, minimal filler. These are the real thing — bound loosely with just enough mayo and egg to hold together, then seared in butter.

**Serves:** 4 | **Time:** 30 minutes + 1 hour chill**

### Ingredients

- 1 lb lump crab meat, picked clean of shells
- ¼ cup mayonnaise
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 1 tbsp Dijon mustard
- 1 tsp Old Bay seasoning
- 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
- ¼ cup fine breadcrumbs (panko or plain)
- Salt and a dash of hot sauce
- Butter and neutral oil for searing
- Lemon and remoulade to serve

### Steps

1. **Gently combine** mayo, egg, mustard, Old Bay, Worcestershire, hot sauce, and parsley in a bowl.
2. **Fold in crab** carefully — use your hands or a spatula and be gentle to keep large lumps intact.
3. **Add breadcrumbs** just until the mixture holds. Don't overwork it.
4. **Form into cakes** about ¾ inch thick. Place on a parchment-lined sheet and refrigerate at least 1 hour (or overnight).
5. **Sear.** Heat a skillet over medium-high heat with butter and oil. Add crab cakes and cook 3–4 minutes per side until deep golden brown.
6. **Drain** on paper towels briefly and serve with lemon and remoulade.

<Callout type="warning" title="Chill before searing">
  Skipping the refrigeration step means the cakes fall apart in the pan. The chill sets the binding — it's not optional.

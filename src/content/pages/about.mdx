## What Is Coastal Kitchen?

Coastal Kitchen is a recipe and cooking resource dedicated to the flavors of the sea. We cover everything from simple weeknight seafood dinners to weekend feasts built around fresh-caught fish and shellfish.

Our focus is practical and ingredient-driven. We want you to know how to pick a good fillet at the market, what to do with a bag of clams before they go bad, and which pantry staples make coastal cooking feel effortless.

## What We Cover

We write about four areas:

- **Recipes** — Tested dishes for clams, salmon, halibut, oysters, shrimp, crab, and more
- **Techniques** — The skills that make everything easier: filleting, grilling over high heat, making stocks, shucking shellfish
- **Pantry** — The essential ingredients that define coastal cooking: fish sauce, good olive oil, smoked paprika, preserved lemons
- **Seasonal notes** — What's at its best and when

## Our Philosophy

We believe coastal cooking is approachable. You don't need to live near the ocean to cook like you do. You need good sourcing, a hot pan, and the confidence to let fresh ingredients do most of the work.

<Callout type="tip" title="Sourcing matters">
  Whenever possible, buy from a fishmonger who can tell you where the fish came from and when it arrived. Freshness at the source makes every technique easier.

We test every recipe multiple times and note where things can go wrong. Our callout boxes flag common mistakes, key timing tips, and substitution ideas.

## How the Site Is Built

Coastal Kitchen is a static site built with [Astro](https://astro.build), deployed to Cloudflare. Content is written in MDX. It's fast, lightweight, and designed to stay out of the way of the recipes.

<Callout type="info" title="Mobile editing">
  This site uses the Loomwork mobile editor at /mobile, a PWA that lets us edit and publish content directly from a phone. Handy for adding notes from the kitchen or the market.

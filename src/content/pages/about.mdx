## What Is Loomwork?

Loomwork is a reusable site starter built on Astro, MDX, and Content Collections. It's designed for people who want to write content in Markdown, push to GitHub, and have a site live in 30 seconds — no CMS, no database, no fuss.

The name comes from the craft of weaving — taking raw threads (your content, your components, your config) and producing something whole.

## Who It's For

Loomwork is for anyone who wants a content-heavy site without the overhead of a full CMS. If you're comfortable editing Markdown files and running `git push`, this is your stack.

Good fits include documentation sites, personal blogs, educational resources, project hubs, and small business sites where the content matters more than the chrome.

## How It Works

Every page on this site is an MDX file in a folder. The file path becomes the URL. A single config file controls the site name, navigation, footer, and branding. Change that file and the CSS variables, and you have a completely different site.

The stack is intentionally simple: Astro builds static HTML at deploy time, Cloudflare Pages serves it globally for free, and GitHub handles version control. No server to maintain, no database to back up, no monthly hosting bill.

## The Fork-and-Rebrand Workflow

Loomwork is meant to be forked. Clone the repo, change `src/site.config.ts` and the CSS variables in `src/styles/site.css`, replace the content, push, and you're live.

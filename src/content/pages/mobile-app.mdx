## What It Is

Loomwork Mobile is a built-in PWA editor served at `/mobile`. It lets you connect to your GitHub repo, edit content files, and publish commits directly from a phone.

## Current Capabilities

- GitHub PAT login
- Content browser for `src/content/pages` and `src/content/posts`
- Body editor + preview + frontmatter editing
- Publish flow that commits directly to `main`
- Local draft persistence

## Quick Start

1. Open `/mobile` on your deployed site
2. Enter `owner/repo` and a PAT with repo content access
3. Open a page, make a small edit, and tap **Publish**
4. Verify commit in GitHub and wait for Cloudflare deploy

## Adding Images in the Editor

You can add images directly from the app using the toolbar image button (`🖼️`) while in Edit mode. The app queues your selected photo for `public/images/`, inserts markdown automatically, and includes everything in the same Publish commit.

You can also write markdown manually in the content body.

```md
![Example screenshot](/images/mobile-editor-example.png)
```

Then place the image file in your repo under `public/images/` so it resolves at `/images/...`.

> Note: there is no media library browser yet; this is direct pick/upload/insert.

## PWA Behavior Notes

- Installed iOS PWAs may not support pull-to-refresh
- Use the header **Reload app** button (`⟲`) to refresh app assets
